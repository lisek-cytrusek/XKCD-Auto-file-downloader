# XKCD-Auto-file-downloader
A program which automatically downloads the xkcd comics + the text that shows up when you hover over a pitcure.
The autodownload is performed on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, so on the days when the page is updated - I have used 
the schedule library by dbader for that (https://schedule.readthedocs.io/).
